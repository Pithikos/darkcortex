		<p>I'm a self-taught UK-based artist, using primarily photography and sound design to create emotion and intrigue.</p>
		
		<p>I enjoy exploring and experimenting with different styles and mediums. This includes more conventional
		   disciplines like monoprinting & drawing up to modern digitization and visualitation using machine learning, AI, softare & hardware.</p>
			
		<p>My work is inspired by the world around me and a fascination with the cosmos at a broader scale.
		   If I can evoke a sense of mystery, curiosity and wonder with my art, then I feel that I've achieved my goal.</p>
