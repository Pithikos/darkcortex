		<p>I'm a self-taught UK-based artist, using primarily photography and sound design to create emotion and intrigue.</p>
		
		<p>I enjoy exploring different styles and mediums, including both analogue and digital techniques and from different scientific fields.</p>
			
		<p>My work is inspired by the world around me, followed by a big IF. The main aims 
			to evoke a sense of wonder, curiosity and wonder about ourselves in the spectacle of the universe and era of digitalism.</p>
